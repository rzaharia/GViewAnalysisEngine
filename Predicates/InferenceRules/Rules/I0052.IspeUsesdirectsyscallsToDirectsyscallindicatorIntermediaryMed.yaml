description: When IsPe(f) ∧ UsesDirectSyscalls(f) holds, assert DirectSyscallIndicator(f)
  {Intermediary, med}.
trigger_logic:
  antecedent:
  - IsPe(f)=true

  consequent:
  - DirectSyscallIndicator(f) {Intermediary, med}=true

  rationale: Derived from rule tier and observed behaviors.
conflict_handling:
  contradicts:
  - 'Rule: R-1980 ''BenignAutoUpdate'''
  resolution: Prefer higher confidence unless allowlist(domain or signer) applies.

  known_bypasses:
  - Direct syscalls to evade hooks
  - Signed vulnerable driver (BYOVD)
  mitigations:
  - Kernel ETW for syscalls
  - Blocklist vulnerable drivers

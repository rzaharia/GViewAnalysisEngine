  contradicts:
  - 'Rule: R-1980 ''BenignAutoUpdate'''
  resolution: Prefer higher confidence unless allowlist(domain or signer) applies.
adversary_evasion:
  known_bypasses:
  - Direct syscalls to evade hooks
  - Signed vulnerable driver (BYOVD)
  mitigations:
  - Kernel ETW for syscalls
  - Blocklist vulnerable drivers

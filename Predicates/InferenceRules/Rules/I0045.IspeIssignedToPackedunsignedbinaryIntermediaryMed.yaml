signature: IsPe(f) ∧ ¬IsSigned(f) ∧ HasHighEntropy(f) → PackedUnsignedBinary(f) {Intermediary,
  med}
category: Behavioral/PEBinary
scope:
  object: file
  postconditions:
  - Derive: PackedUnsignedBinary(f) {Intermediary, med}
description: When IsPe(f) ∧ ¬IsSigned(f) ∧ HasHighEntropy(f) holds, assert PackedUnsignedBinary(f)
  {Intermediary, med}.
trigger_logic:
  antecedent:
  - IsPe(f)=true
  - ¬IsSigned(f)=true
  - HasHighEntropy(f)=true
  consequent:
  - PackedUnsignedBinary(f) {Intermediary, med}=true

confidence:
  base: 0.6
  modifiers:
  - 'if Unsigned(binary): +0.05'

severity:
  level: info
  rationale: Derived from rule tier and observed behaviors.
conflict_handling:
  contradicts:
  - 'Rule: R-1980 ''BenignAutoUpdate'''
  resolution: Prefer higher confidence unless allowlist(domain or signer) applies.
adversary_evasion:
  known_bypasses:
  - Direct syscalls to evade hooks
  - Signed vulnerable driver (BYOVD)
  mitigations:
  - Kernel ETW for syscalls
  - Blocklist vulnerable drivers

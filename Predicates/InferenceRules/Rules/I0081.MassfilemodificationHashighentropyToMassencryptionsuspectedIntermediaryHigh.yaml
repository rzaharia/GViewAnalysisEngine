signature: MassFileModification(f) ∧ HasHighEntropy(f) → MassEncryptionSuspected(f)
  {Intermediary, high}
category: Behavioral/Ransomware
scope:
  object: file
  postconditions:
  - Derive: MassEncryptionSuspected(f) {Intermediary, high}
description: When MassFileModification(f) ∧ HasHighEntropy(f) holds, assert MassEncryptionSuspected(f)
  {Intermediary, high}.
trigger_logic:
  antecedent:
  - MassFileModification(f)=true
  - HasHighEntropy(f)=true
  consequent:
  - MassEncryptionSuspected(f) {Intermediary, high}=true

signature: IsPe(f) ∧ (CreatesRemoteThread(f) ∨ WritesProcessMemory(f) ∨ AllocatesRWXMemory(f))
  → InjectionBehavior(f) {Intermediary, high}
category: Behavioral/PEBinary
scope:
  object: file
  postconditions:
  - Derive: InjectionBehavior(f) {Intermediary, high}
description: When IsPe(f) ∧ (CreatesRemoteThread(f) ∨ WritesProcessMemory(f) ∨ AllocatesRWXMemory(f))
  holds, assert InjectionBehavior(f) {Intermediary, high}.
trigger_logic:
  antecedent:
  - IsPe(f)=true
  - (CreatesRemoteThread(f) ∨ WritesProcessMemory(f) ∨ AllocatesRWXMemory(f))=true
  consequent:
  - InjectionBehavior(f) {Intermediary, high}=true

  rationale: Derived from rule tier and observed behaviors.
conflict_handling:
  contradicts:
  - 'Rule: R-1980 ''BenignAutoUpdate'''
  resolution: Prefer higher confidence unless allowlist(domain or signer) applies.
adversary_evasion:
  known_bypasses:
  - Direct syscalls to evade hooks
  - Signed vulnerable driver (BYOVD)
  mitigations:
  - Kernel ETW for syscalls
  - Blocklist vulnerable drivers
